Human Resources Attrition Prediction
This project uses machine learning to analyze employee data and predict attrition. By classifying employees into those likely to leave and those who are likely to stay, the goal is to help HR teams implement proactive retention strategies.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed employee data for analysis.
Machine Learning: Applied classification algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest) to predict employee turnover based on features like age, distance from home, salary, and years at the company.
Data Analysis: Identified key factors influencing attrition rates, providing actionable insights to HR departments.
Data Visualization: Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize trends and model predictions, making the results easy to interpret for HR teams.

Technologies Used:
Python
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
Microsoft SQL Server
Power BI
